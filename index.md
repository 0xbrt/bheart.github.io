    ## Who I am

    I'm Will[iam].

    A comp.sci. student at [Aarhus University](https://www.au.dk/) with a passion for anything from low-level systems programming to high-level user interactions.

  what-i-do: |
    ## What I do

    Studies aside, currently in gear with <https://trifork.com/> -- time most of which has been spent with TypeScript -- although with everything from Splunk API to Docker/Kubernetes pods sprinkled inbetween.

  what-ive-done: |
    ## What I've done

    One project of note is <https://disassemb.ly/> -- an x86 disassembler meant to illustrate the assembly/machine code translation -- although written in Rust, it targets everything from natively built terminal applications to WebAssembly fueled browser interfaces.

    Although limited, you're welcome to check me out on GitHub [@s1gtrap](https://github.com/s1gtrap).
